        <h1>Operation Nick Game Rules</h1>
        
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of Operation Nick is for the students to catch the lecturer, who is trying to evade capture while traveling around Horsforth. The lecturer wins if he successfully avoids capture until the end of the game.</p>

        <h2>Game Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The game is designed for 2 to 6 players.</li>
            <li>One player assumes the role of the lecturer, while the others act as students.</li>
            <li>Each player receives a set of tickets: taxi, bus, and underground tickets.</li>
            <li>The lecturer starts with a special invisibility ticket that they can use once during the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Players take turns moving around the board. Each turn consists of the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lecturer moves first and reveals their location by using a ticket.</li>
            <li>Students then take turns moving towards the lecturerâ€™s last known location.</li>
            <li>Students must announce their mode of transport when they move.</li>
            <li>If a student lands on the same space as the lecturer, they are caught, and the students win!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>The game ends when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lecturer is caught by a student, resulting in a win for the students.</li>
            <li>The lecturer successfully evades capture for a predetermined number of turns, resulting in a win for the lecturer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If the lecturer uses their invisibility ticket, they can move to any location without revealing their position.</li>
            <li>Students should communicate and strategize together to corner the lecturer and limit their escape options.</li>
            <li>Players can only move to connected locations as per the transport tickets they possess.</li>
        </ul>
